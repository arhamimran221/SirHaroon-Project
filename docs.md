# Best Practices

- Always add a semi colon
- File names should use node conventions eg `form-component.jsx` - Kebab case
- Should put EOF (end of file) at the end of file.
- Folder names should be small case (`example`).
- Should had to improve reuseability and readability of the code.
- Should not use same element and the set of code again and again.
- Make another component for the code which is seems to be used more then 1 time.
